# pulsar_star_analysis
Notebook with data analysis ( model evaluation and dimensionality reduction ) of pulsar data available at kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/pavanraj159/predicting-a-pulsar-star

[!] Notebook contains few interactive plots and visualizations ( github won't show the results, it's best to download notebook and dataset from website ( just put .csv in folder with notebook )  and run it in your browser). Link to my kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/levusik/born-to-spin
